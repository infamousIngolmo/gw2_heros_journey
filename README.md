The intent is:
 * for characters which the player meets to be more present in the world rather than at every 10 levels
 * intertwine the events or hearts on the map into a story which compliments the main story line
 * have each be in the "voice" of the actual character, using similar mannerism's or sayings
 * If possible tie in: jumping puzzles, world bosses and dungeons when they are presented to the player
